### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I provide analysis and tooling so that [Ship Creek Group](https://www.shipcreekgroup.com/) can make data-informed decisions to advance progressive political and advocacy efforts in Alaska. Day to day that means writing flexible, repeatable, explainable software that can clean and interpret messy demographic and donation data. Think analyseses of how people vote, data pipelines to [track bills and the voting records of the Alaska Legislature](https://github.com/ShipCreekGroup/alaska-legislative-data), cleaning and performing record linkage on [public campaign contribution data](https://github.com/NickCrews/apoc-data), and [tracking the investments of the Alaska Permanent Fund](https://github.com/ShipCreekGroup/permanent-fund-tracker). As part of this data linkage work, I am publicly developing a data linkage library, [mismo](https://github.com/NickCrews/mismo), which may be of interest to you, though it is still very alpha.

We rely heavily on python, particularly [ibis]([url](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis)) (which I help maintain) as a dataframe interface on top of [duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) as the execution engine. This is an ergonomic, scalable solution that I can run across gygabytes of data on my laptop, and easily deploy to cron jobs via github actions. I am the only software engineer at Ship Creek Group, so I strongly prefer technologies that are free, avoid vendor lockin, and require little overhead.

In the past I worked on the ChromeOS team at Google to build new Chromebooks. I mostly worked on low-level C code that I upstreamed into the linux kernel, but also did some C++, Go, and python applications.

Outside of software, I've commercially fished for seven seasons on an Alaskan boat, tutored STEM and rock climbing, built a tiny home, won international physics competitions, and designed and machined precision instruments for physics experiments.
